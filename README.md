# Flu-Season-Tableau
Created a research hypothesis for medical staffing. Used Excel to clean and transform data, and Tableau to create a storyboard to present to stakeholders.

# Goal
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.

# Overiew 
● Motivation: The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.

● Objective: Determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state.

● Scope: The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.

# Data
Used Excel to for data quality to clean, transmform, and integrate data sets. 

● Population Death Data- shows the US population from 2009 to 2017 broken down by county, gender, and age groups by every 5 years. 

● Influenza Death Data- contains monthly death counts for influenza-related deaths in the United States from 2009 to 2017. Counts are broken into two categories: state and age.

# Research Hypothesis
Elderly people are part of the vulnerable population. If you are over 65 then the influenza mortality rate will increase. 

# Tools
● Excel- Data analysist 

● Tableau- All visualizations were created in Tableau Public and may be viewed in the attached [Tableau Workbook.] (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/emily.limeta/viz/Upcomingfluseasonstoryboard/Story1?publish=yes)
